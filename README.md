### What I learned

This project was a good refresher in making API calls.

I'm proud of the fact that the design is generally responsive without the need for any media queries, due the use of css such as: 

.advice-area {
    position: relative;
    width: min(100% - 2rem, 28rem); /* chooses the smaller of the 2 */
    margin: 5rem auto;
    margin-inline: auto;
}


### Continued development

I'd like to experiment more with more complex API calls, and manipulation of the data received from the call, including POST, PUT requests etc.
